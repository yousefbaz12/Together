### PADDY DISEASE DETICTION 
We provide a training dataset of 10,407 (75%) labeled paddy leaf images across ten classes (nine diseases and normal leaf). We also provide additional metadata for each image, such as the paddy variety and age. Your task is to develop an accurate disease classification model using the training dataset and then classify each sample in the test dataset of 3,469 (25%) paddy leaf images into one of the nine diseases or normal leaf.
