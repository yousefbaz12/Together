#COTTON WEED DETICTION 
The dataset CottonWeedID15 consists of 5187 RGB images of 15 weeds that are common in cotton fields in the southern U.S. states. These images were acquired by either smartphones or hand-held digital cameras, under natural field light condition and at varied stages of weed growth in 2020 and 2021. The images were manually labeled by weed scientists and trained individuals.

Detailed documentation of the dataset and related benchmarking of deep learning models for weed identification is given in an accompanying journal paper paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2022.107091 and https://github.com/Derekabc/CottonWeeds
